## About me
I'm a developer learning, building, and sharing small projects. I enjoy turning ideas into working code and improving through real-world practice and contributions. My recent work includes a web project (`crop-management-system`) and several small repositories to learn and experiment.

---

## Highlights
- 🔧 Working on frontend projects (HTML/CSS) and simple web apps  
- 📁 Recent repositories: `crop-management-system`, `exp2`, `mca01`  
- ✅ Created commits and repositories to practice real-world development workflows

---

## Selected Projects
### `crop-management-system`
A small web project (HTML) focused on basic crop management UI and functionality — ideal for learning CRUD-like flows and frontend basics.

### `exp2`
An experimental repository for learning and trying new ideas (placeholder — replace with details).

### `mca01`
Course/work-related repository (placeholder — replace with details).

> Add a short README inside each repository with tech stack, features, and how to run it locally.

---

## Tech & Tools
- HTML / CSS  
- Git & GitHub (regular commits & repo management)  
- Comfortable experimenting with simple web stacks

*(If you'd like, I can expand this with frameworks, languages, or tools you use.)*

---

## Contribution activity
I make regular small contributions and create repositories to learn. Tracking contributions on my GitHub profile helps me stay accountable and improve over time.

---

## How to collaborate
1. Fork the repo you want to contribute to.  
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-change`  
3. Commit with clear messages and push: `git commit -m "feat: add X"` then `git push origin feature/my-change`  
4. Open a Pull Request describing what you changed and why.  
5. I will review and respond — or feel free to open an issue first to discuss bigger ideas.

## Quick tips for this profile
- Add short README files to each repository with:
  - What the project does
  - How to run it locally
  - Example screenshots or demo link
- Add a pinned repositories list on your GitHub profile to highlight the best projects.
- Keep the bio short and link to a portfolio or docs if available.

---

## License
This profile README is free to reuse. For individual project repos, add a license file (MIT is a common, permissive choice).

If you want, I can:
- Generate detailed README files for any of your repositories (`crop-management-system`, `exp2`, or `mca01`), or
- Turn this into a cleaned-up GitHub profile README with badges and GitHub activity widgets.

Just tell me which repo to start with! 🚀
